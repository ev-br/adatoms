adatoms
=======

Simulates a high-temperature expansion series for the thermodynamics of magnetic adatoms on graphene or a topological insulator. See Phys. Rev. B 86, 054424 (2012) for details (preprint: http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4096).

Requires ALPS libraries (http://alps.comp-phys.org) ver 1.3 (2.0 should probably work as well) and LAPACK.  
 
Public domain.
A citation of the PRB original paper would be appreciated.
